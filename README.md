# polyhere
Geometric pattern generator that draws lots of polygons in SVG

	# Goals
	
	    - Change the shape of designs in real time by adjusting values (seed config, shape config, etc.)
		- Create designs that can be exported to svg 
		- Laser cut designs as a mandala for lighting, etching, engraving, etc. 
		- Eventual ambient control of designs 
		
	# Challenges
	
		- Shape collision needs to be handled 
		- Removing shape overlaps with box boundaries 
		- P ort from python into Processing or Unity for 2d drawing (would unity render much faster?)
